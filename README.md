Hi, I’m Vuuouiwons – developer and tech enthusiast dedicated to building scalable, real-world solutions. My GitHub is a playground where I explore a range of projects, from a minimal Go backend service using Gin to innovative fintech applications like dynamic QRIS generation with Midtrans. With a strong background in Electrical Engineering / Computer Science and hands-on experience in IoT, robotics, and machine learning, I enjoy diving into cutting-edge technologies, mentoring others, and writing about the latest in tech.

Whether you’re here to check out robust backend APIs, explore payment integrations, or see creative implementations in open source, you’re in the right place. Join me on this journey as I tackle real-world challenges and build efficient, future-ready systems.

Feel free to connect, contribute, or just say hello!
